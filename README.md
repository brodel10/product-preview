## My process

Approach:
I structured the page by breaking it into logical sections. Each section was grouped and styled to ensure a consistent flow of information. My goal was to design a clean, visually appealing interface that remains responsive across various screen sizes.

To achieve this, I used a combination of Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout and alignment. Flexbox was ideal for centering and aligning elements, while CSS Grid allowed me to manage complex layouts, like the nutrition table, with precision and flexibility.
